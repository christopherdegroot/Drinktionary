# About Drinktionary

Users can search drinks by category and choose how many results to show. The goal Drinktionary is to provide user-friendly access to new drink and cocktail ideas, no matter what the occasion. Make sure to enter your date of birth correctly to gain access to the app and please drink responsibly!
